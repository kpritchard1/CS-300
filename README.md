# CS-300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For two projects, I was instructed to design a pseudocode that would read from a file, sort the data correctly, and print the information requested from user input. After, I was instructed to design the code that was mapped out in the prior pseudocode. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problems by using the algorithms that would solve the specific problem at hand. For example, I used the sorting algorithm that would sort the data into alphabetical order. Having two things in mind, that algorithms are basically recipes that helps you with a specific task and knowing that there was a sorting algorithm that could help me sort information in alphabetical/numerical order saved me a ton of time researching how to solve the problem when I basically had a template. 
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The only roadblock that I encountered while going through the projects was being able to completely match the code from the pseudocode given that pseudocode is only a summary of what you will be doing. I overcome this I just kept looking at the algorithms that could help with the task at hand until I got the syntax correct for the actual project's situation. 
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This has expanded my knowledge in developing programs altogether because I'm no longer looking at a project from start to finish. Now, I am focusing on the tasks at hand and searching for an algorithm that can help me with just that.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Again, algorithms will help me with being able to write programs using less code and coding only what I need.
